A simple dice roller and parser for macOS written in Swift.

Dice syntax is "xdy", where x is the number of dice to be rolled and y is the number of sides on each dice. Feel free to combine different dice, add or substract modifiers, or even perform math on the results.

Inspired by Dicy, an old Mac dice roller written by Florent Alexandre. Check his iOS dice roller Hedra at https://appsto.re/be/twkOkb.i
